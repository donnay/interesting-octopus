In the inky blackness of the fierce downpour a figure bundled up against the elements hurried along the stony path leading to the squat dwelling. The walls mostly glass and opaque, signalled the light and warmth inside. As he approached, the house detected the presence and a moment before he would have to slow his pace to avoid colliding with the front door, it's large wooden ornately carved mass swung open silently. 

The house guided him to the bedroom, steps away from the door to the master he head a woman cry out. 

The doctor rounded the corner as said. "Another contraction? Good, they are getting more frequent" 

"And more intense" Saraha replied.

"Thank you for coming at such a late, er ...  I guess so early this morning" The tall, muscular man holding the woman's had said.

The doctor nodded almost imperceptibly, "I am the village doctor ... house calls are part of the service". "Name's Dr. Jelan Proda, please call me Jelan."

"And you are Peter Pendleton and this is of course your wife Saraha." He placed his bag on a side table, retrieved a device from it and approached her all-in-one quick fluid motion. He continued talking.

"I was monitoring your wife's bio-stats since last week, after last week's tele-town-hall, when your arrival was announced. I see you've been settling in well."

"Yes," said Peter. "The move to Earth wen't well and I;ve had lots of time to un-pack"

Another contraction begins

Saraha's contractions have intessified and she has progressed into labour accouding to the disgnostic AI on the doctors tablet and the biomed algos in the house's core. The house is reccomending a mild tranquilizer to ease the pain of it's owner.

Jelan reviews the house's reccomendaiton on his tablet and agrees. He places a small circular adhesive patch, on Saraha's left wrist. The transderminals go to work immediatly and the pain is reduced.

After several hours, Vaughn Marie Pendelton was born. At 7:03 am UTC March 21, 2198 on Burrard Island, Canada.

"Thank you Jelan!" Peter said as he shook the doctor's three fingered hand.

"Just part of the service", Jelan's single eye blinked once, then once again. Eebek's eye blinks are like shoulder shrugs of humans.

"Human live birth is such an amazing process, I've been facinated with it since I learned about humans at the acedemy. So much more invasice than the eggs the Eebek's lay"

"Now, take it easy for the next couple days Saraha. I know you eager to return to work. But you must give your self time to recover."

Jelan swiveled his eye stalk between Peter and Saraha. "No more than 50% of your work load. 2 hours per day tops! Agreed?!", his eye binked repeatidly.

Sarah started to protest "but they need ..."

The large eye raised up on it stalk and moved toward Saraha.

".. all right, doctors' orders"
