“Sir, the computers just came back online.”</p>
“Well, do they confirm the visuals?”</p>
“Yes Sir!”</p>
“Run down the stats Mr. Kielan”</p>
“The computer is tracking the asteroid. Sensors are picking up high ore content. Large Deposits of Gold, Titanium, Palladium and traces of other metals as long as your arm.”</p>
“Is their a margin?”</p>
“Nine million cubic meters with a ratio of twelve to one.”</p>
“Position and vector Mr. Harcher”</p>
“It entered our claim six hours ago and is in a transfer orbit that will take it out in another two hours.”</p>
“Shit! Pull in the five and six crews. This is going to have be fast and dirty.”</p>
“Mr. Dlameani, find the fastest course to the asteroid.”</p>
“The sensors show a Kirkwood, Captain.”</p>
“Use it!”</p>
“It’s very small.”</p>
“I don’t care, I want that asteroid.”</p>
“Are the 5 and 6 crews in yet?”</p>
“Yes, Captain”</p>
“Engage the drive Mr. Dlameani, ETA at best speed?”</p>
“15 min. Captain.”</p>
“It’s going to be tight. I want all crews ready for immediate deployment when we reach station.”</p>
<center> . . .</center></p>
“ETA Mr. Dlameani.”</p>
“30 seconds to station Captain.”</p>
“Are all crews ready?”</p>
“All report ready, Sir.”</p>
“ETA?”</p>
“10 seconds.”</p>
“Time until the asteroid leaves the claim Mr. Marcher?”</p>
“One hour and thirty-two minutes, Captain.”</p>
“Open the pod bay doors.”</p>
“Eye Eye.”</p>
“Attention all out-rigger crews, I want this operation to go smoothly. We only have one and a half hours and any time wasted will come off your commissions. Deploy, — NOW!”</p>
“All crews acknowledge deployment. Sir.”</p>
“Mr. Kielan, I want the data from the first samples.”</p>
“Updated ratio of nine to one. Percent composition of primary samples: 3.5% Gold, 1.7% Platinum, 2.5% Cobalt, 1.1% Palladium, and .5% Courant — the rest are just traces.”</p>
“Courant!?”</p>
“Yes, Captain.”</p>
“Are there any concentrations of it.”</p>
“The sensors indicate a vein on the far side.”</p>
“I want two crews on it as soon as possible.”</p>
“Out-rigger crews two and seven are in position on the far side and beginning there OP, Captain.”</p>
“Report Mr. Kielan”</p>
“Ratio of Courant ten to one.”</p>
“Do we have estimates on vein size.”</p>
“Computers estimate — One Million cubic meters. Captain!”</p>
“My God. This is the one.”</p>
“ETD until it leaves our Claim, Mr. Marcher.”</p>
“One hour and five minutes, Sir.”</p>
“Mr. Kielan, keep me updated on completion percentage.”</p>
“At the current rate we have five percent dusted, and time to full dust one hour and forty-nine minutes.”</p>
“Dam it! I want all teams to go to one hundred thirty percent.”</p>
“All out-riggers acknowledge.”</p>
“Mr. Bycore give me the stress data on the pods.”</p>
“All are working at maximum efficiency, there is a five percent chance of system failure every five minutes we maintain one thirty. Sir.”</p>
“Move another two crews to the far side.”</p>
“Crews four and five on station and starting their OP”</p>
“Mr. Kielan ?”</p>
“Fifteen percent dusted, and one hour and fifteen minutes to full dust.”</p>
“ETD of the asteroid out of our claim Mr. Marcher?”</p>
“Fifty minutes, Captain.”</p>
“ETD Mr. Harcher?”</p>
<center> . . .</center></p>
“The Asteroid is now three minutes away from the line.”</p>
“Percentage Mr. Kielan?”</p>
“Eighty-three percent dusted, and fifteen minutes to full dust.”</p>
“Stress data Mr. Bycore.”</p>
“Seventy-eight percent average efficiency. Thirty percent chance of failure every minute.”</p>
“ETD Mr. Ha…”</p>
“Captain, pods three and seven have lost all power.”</p>
“Status on the crews Mr. Bycore?”</p>
“Out-riggers three and seven are on Batt backup and are drifting out of the claim.”</p>
“Dam it, Bycore, why weren’t they using pitons?”</p>
“The out-riggers are using station keeping thrusters and emergency lines to save time.”</p>
“Percent Mr. Kielan?”</p>
“Eighty five, 13 min to full.”</p>
“We are now across the line.”</p>
“Dlameani, Keep me posted on any host movements.”</p>
“Bycore, have the pods regained power?”</p>
“Yes, Captain. The pods are now back at station.”</p>
“Sir, Computer is tracking another mining vessel on an intercept course.”</p>
“Percent Mr. Kielan?”</p>
“Eighty nine, 10 min to full.”</p>
“Time to interception of the other vessel, Dlameani?”</p>
“Two minutes Captain.”</p>
“Sir, We are receiving a signal from the other ship.”</p>
“Out loud, Dlameani.”</p>
“They are demanding that we leave their claim immediately or they will destroy our vessel and all crews for the crime of claim jumping.”</p>
“Pull in the crews Mr. Bycore.”</p>
<center> . . .</center></p>
“Sir, the other ship is now retreating form our claim.”</p>
“Give, me the stats on the asteroid Mr. Raoklan”</p>
“The computer is tracking. Sensors show high ore content. Deposits of Gold, Titanium, Palladium and traces of other metals.”</p>
“What’s the margin?”</p>
“Nine hundred thousand cubic meters with a ratio of ten to one.”</p>
“Position and vector Mr. Garone”</p>
