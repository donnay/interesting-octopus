### Physiology
Humans are mammals
- humans are fairly vulnerable to their environment but are surprisingly adaptable because of their technology
- they have two arms two legs and opposable thumbs
- come in a wide range of colors and textures
- they have hair in selected areas of their body
- different bodily distribution between sexes
- omnivorous
- the enzyme
- alcohol kills tissues and humans are the only race which can pass alcohol without side effects.
- their lips are fairly flexible
- walk upright
- four chambered heart
- appendix vestigial from grazing
- externalized organs
9 month gestation no mating season 1 child per birth
- we need oxygen at a certain pressure </p>

The process of heat conduction and absorption is still a valuable source of energy to the Fenbin, especially during the summer. The opposing colours cause heat currents in fluid channels within the thorax and abdomen, and this action drives molecule sized thermal-pumps that make high energy molecules that can be stored or used as needed. 
The organs of their respiratory system are mainly located in the abdomen and open to the atmosphere through the first groove in
the exoskeleton where the legs originate. This slit is surrounded by stiff hairs that are kept moist to clean the inhaled air of fine particles and dust. A long windpipe joins the central sack, in the abdomen, with the horn structure atop the head. This connection was used to provide air to the individual when hunting (they buried themselves and would pounce upon unsuspecting prey) but now it is used for purely ceremonial uses. Their small and delicately structured heart is placed low in the thorax, and indicative of the light gravity of Tabell. Their weak heart, by our standards, still manages efficient oxygenation of their iron based blood. Their digestive system is strictly that of a carnivore specially equipped for an insect diet. 
Females Fenbin are larger than males, and they choose their mates at the beginning of the great celebration. The sexual organs share a duct with the spinneret, and copulation results in the male passing of a package of sperm wrapped in spun fibres to the female. She can then store the sperm or use it to fertilize her eggs. Fertilization will yield 2-3 dozen eggs all wrapped in cocoon. After three months the young will emerge for the cocoon and begin a process of growth that will last for the first 11 years of life. During this time they remain in the city as they would not survive in the extreme environment away from the city.
