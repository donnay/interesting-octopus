## Introduction
All modern clothing has features and characteristics that are extraordinary. Almost all garments are completely composed  of synthetic fibers, but great strides have been made in the 'feel' of these fabrics. Many simulate cotton, wool, and  other natural fibers but they have none of the draw-backs. The fibers are woven so that they stretch and relax allowing  wrinkles to melt away in short course. Cleaning garments made of theses synthetics is not necessary ever since the  addition of resident bacteria cultures. The microscopic organisms are embedded into the threads where they digest the  various bodily excretions, and clean off dirt and stains. And since they are not exposed to the harsh cleaning process  garments last much longer and look new longer. Garments are all manufactured extra large with various methods to adjust  to the wearers' size. Overall, the clothing of today has greater flexibility and better user qualities, requiring less  work to look your best even in worst environments.

###Exposure Suit
Laced with heating and cooling coils this suit is more like a bag. By climbing into the suit the wearer is protected  for heat and cold extremes. This performs essentially the same function as a thermal suit with none of the mobility it  allows.  

###Gravity Pants
Used to lessen the number of G's the wearer feels, these can counter up 1 G of force. They effectively return the wearer to normal functioning even in high gravity environments.

###Magnesocks
This are used in zero-G environments to hold the wearer on to the floor. Especially useful on space platforms and stations without synthetic gravity these are often equipment found on such installations.

###Radiation Suit
Consisting of multiple layers of fabrics and liners the suit will reflect excess radiation (within reason) and bring levels down to livable limits.

###Space / Pressure Suit
Capable of basic life support the suit provides ventilation, heating and cooling, and radiation protection. The suit is constructed from very thin material and is primarily for working in low pressure zero-g environments

###Thermal Suit
A thermal suit is a tight-fitting elastic body glove designed to protect its wearer from temperature extremes. It consists of numerous layers of synthetic water and fire-proof fabrics and insulates woven around the mesh of a microtubule cooling and heating system. When fully donned Thermals  completely cover the wearer's exposed body surfaces even the face (although some manufacturers now provide detachable limbs) which will protect against
atmospheric pressures as low as 0.3 and as high as 1.2 atmospheres for extended periods. Outside of the remarkably efficient body heat recycling system provided naturally by the suit's cloth, additional heat and cold can be supplied by a small helium pump on the suit's bib. A small touch console giving the outside temperature, probable perceived temperature, body temperature, etc. as well as temperature adjustment controls and programming inputs for special conditions (keep the body temperature stable if worker is endothermic, immediately cool the body upon death to prevent decomposition. Mixed with a special thermal catalyst, helium gas moves through the micro-tubing losing heat energy electro-chemically to the surrounding materials (comfortable until about -85°C). Then when the temperature increases toward zero, the gas re-absorbs heat energy from the suit and body (comfortable up to 125°C). If this isn't enough electric heating coils and a helium vacuum pump can be employed to extend the suit's limits to -130 to 170°C. A thermal suit is powered by 2 batt A's which under normal conditions will provide 100 hrs. of use. If the coils or vacuum pump must be used this life-time falls to 45
hrs.   

###VAC Suit
Essentially a tougher version of the space suit this one is constructed for rugged environments and heavy duty users. The outer layers provide a tough skin that will resist tears and protect the occupant. Additional armour can be added to further increase its durability to weapon damage.
