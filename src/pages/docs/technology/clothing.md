## Introduction
All modern clothing has features and characteristics that are extraordinary. Almost all garments are completely composed  of synthetic fibers, but great strides have been made in the 'feel' of these fabrics. Many simulate cotton, wool, and  other natural fibers but they have none of the draw-backs. The fibers are woven so that they stretch and relax allowing  wrinkles to melt away in short course. Cleaning garments made of theses synthetics is not necessary ever since the  addition of resident bacteria cultures. The microscopic organisms are embedded into the threads where they digest the  various bodily excretions, and clean off dirt and stains. And since they are not exposed to the harsh cleaning process  garments last much longer and look new longer. Garments are all manufactured extra large with various methods to adjust  to the wearers' size. Overall, the clothing of today has greater flexibility and better user qualities, requiring less  work to look your best even in worst environments.

###Exposure Suit
Laced with heating and cooling coils this suit is more like a bag. By climbing into the suit the wearer is protected  for heat and cold extremes. This performs essentially the same function as a thermal suit with none of the mobility it  allows.  

###Gravity Pants
Used to lessen the number of G's the wearer feels, these can counter up 1 G of force. They effectively return the wearer to normal functioning even in high gravity environments.

###Magnesocks
This are used in zero-G environments to hold the wearer on to the floor. Especially useful on space platforms and stations without synthetic gravity these are often equipment found on such installations.

###Radiation Suit
Consisting of multiple layers of fabrics and liners the suit will reflect excess radiation (within reason) and bring levels down to livable limits.

###Space / Pressure Suit
Capable of basic life support the suit provides ventilation, heating and cooling, and radiation protection. The suit is constructed from very thin material and is primarily for working in low pressure zero-g environments

###Thermal Suit
Insert Thermal suit description.

###VAC Suit
Essentially a tougher version of the space suit this one is constructed for rugged environments and heavy duty users. The outer layers provide a tough skin that will resist tears and protect the occupant. Additional armour can be added to further increase its durability to weapon damage.
