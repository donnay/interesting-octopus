### Introduction

##### Grim Reaper
One of the newest products in bio-engineering technology, this small fuzzy creature has been designed as an organic backup for most bodily functions. Its body is approximately half a cubic meter in volume and it has two short arms wrap around the wearer's neck and lock in place. Once attached a reaper will assume all normal circulatory, respiratory, digestive, and excretory function, until the patient's own systems have recovered. A fresh reaper has a store of fat that it uses for nutrition, as it stabilizes patients. The store will be enough to for one day with the most critically wounded patients, and longer for the less severely wounded. Reapers are omnivores that eat through a small opening just below the patient's own mouth. Reapers eat three meals a day and properly fed they can support a patient indefinitely. Models are available that can secrete various medicines directly into the patients, at slightly higher cost. Only available for Eebeks and Humans, models for other races are under development.
NOTE: using an inappropriate model would inflict more damage then it heals.
