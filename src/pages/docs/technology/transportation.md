## Organic

### Dowser
Light bipedal creatures a dowser stands 2.5 meters tall and the saddle is 1.5 m off the ground. They have hair,  essentially wool, and they are usually shaved. Their wool coat can protect them in cool environments but they prefer the  desert.  

### Nuage
A large horse-like beast of burden standing 2 meters tall at the shoulders that walks on four legs. A nauge is covered  in long shaggy hair, making it excellent for cool and cold environments. Capable of carrying up to 1 tonne for 4 hours  at a stretch they are the best of all pack animals for endurance and strength.

##Inorganic
For those vehicles obtaining substantial velocities scanners and radar are standard equipment, all other vehicles can be  fitted with scanners, radar, computers and weapons if they are bought for the vehicle. All forms of transportation use a  standard "batt" as their power source (which are functionally all the same, but differ in size). EVERY vehicle comes  equipped with five FLARES and a SMALL REPAIR KIT all others systems are optional and must be bought by the vehicle's  purchaser along with the vehicle.

### Wheel
The Name WHEEL is already in its plural form so when saying that you had seen more than one wheel you would  say "I saw ten WHEEL". The WHEEL is basically a center cockpit with a thick, wide tire running completely around  its circumference. The tire is about ten cm. thick all around except on the tread when it thickens to twenty cm.  The cockpit remains upright regardless of the speed of the tire. The driving force of the WHEEL is a large motor  underneath the cockpit that spins the WHEEL by means of gear teeth surrounding the inside diameter of the tire. The  motor then applies a cog to these teeth and, by means of a transmission and a differential, the WHEEL is moved along  at its TOP SPEED (see below). The hemispherical "hub caps" on each side of the tires are to allow more room for  the occupant to sit and to operate the vehicle and more room for the one passenger. Breaking is accomplished by  removing the driving force from  gear teeth and a flywheel, spinning in the opposite direction of the wheel,  counteracts the motion of the tire and the vehicle slows down. The seats are thickly padded as a standard feature  because of the extreme speeds. To turn, the WHEEL tilts into the turn a varying degree depending on the speed at  which the turn is being attempted. By tilting, the WHEEL can turn very sharp corners and still be able to sustain  the same speed. The maximum speed that the WHEEL can travel in its tightest turning circle is 200 Km/h. All other  turns are classified a shallow, sharp or very sharp the maximum speed that is possible in each is 360, 300 or 220  Km/h respectively.   
TOP SPEED: 410 Km/h
CRUISING SPEED: 380 Km/h  DIMENSIONS (Dia.*W): 5 * 3m
BASE PRICE: 6700 Dits  LENGTH OF USE / BATT: 24 hours

### Wheels
This is a central cockpit suspended between two separate wheels. The central cockpit stays upright regardless  of speed due to a large gyroscope that stabilizes it. The hemispherical hub caps on the sides of each wheel are to  prevent the WHEELS from coming to rest on an end if it were to flip. The central cockpit can accommodate four  persons, one of which is the driver, the rest can operate any weapons or subsidiary systems. The WHEELS, like the  WHEEL, comes equipped with thickly padded seats, and because of the large differences in velocity, and due to the  specialized way in which persons on the outside of the vehicle can be removed a five point harnesses is included.  The cockpit can be locked to spin at the same rate as the tires. Then the centrifugal force exerted on the enemy  would be so great that it would be impossible to remain attached to exterior of the cockpit.  
WARNING ANY OCCUPANTS  NOT WEARING THE FIVE POINT HARNESS WILL FLY AROUND INSIDE THE COCKPIT, IF IT IS LOCKED AND SPUN.
The braking system  is different to the WHEEL, in that breaking weights, inside the wheel, are used. Normally the weights are kept near  the center of the axle, when breaking is desired the weights are released on cables and they slow down the vehicle.  Reverse direction can be applied to the tires to stop in a shorter distance but usually the large weights are  sufficient to slow the WHEELS down. The horizontal support is shaped like an inverted wing so that at high speeds  the vehicle will maintain traction.
TOP SPEED: 380 Km/h

### Hover Bike
The HOVERBIKE is the fastest form of conventional transportation second only to a "DELTA-WARP" unit. The HOVER  BIKE was designed to carry one person, the operator of the vehicle. This person steers by a straight forward and  backward motion of the steering arms. A special PAD suit, with a metal plate in the chest region, must be worn  while operating the BIKE. The HOVER BIKE has a scoop on its underside where air pressure drives a turbine and  powers an electromagnet. The electromagnet "holds" the driver in place when the vehicle is travelling at great  speeds. The faster the bike travels, the greater force holding him against the BIKE, so the driver can't blow off.  Other safety features have been built into the HOVER BIKE such as a contour seat that is comprised of 10 cm. of  high density foam. The driver also wears a special helmet that is shaped to be as aerodynamic. The  HOVER BIKE hover height can be adjusted from a max. of 5m down to .2m  min. The drivers feet are placed on the  2 foot rests at either side of the BIKE, legs bent forward at the hip and back at the knees. Finally the  driver  leans totally forward and places his chest against the fuel tank.  In this position the driver is safe form the  blasting wind which could rip him off the seat. The rear burner supplies additional thrust when the user requires  it but only when the vehicle is travelling over 500 Km/h.

### Climber
 The CLIMBER or TWO-LEGGED MURPHY, as it is sometimes known to the older Prospectors, is a slow, bulky vehicle  built for moving over rugged terrain. It was designed by Humans in the 60's and is made for Humans so only closely  conforming humanoid races may pilot a CLIMBER. While modifications can be made to a degree, over 90% of the  CLIMBERS encountered are Human fitted.  The CLIMBER is essentially a high-powered exoskeleton which upgrades the users Physical Strength by 110 points  while similarly decreasing his Agility by 25 points, so as to gain stability on the rugged ground it encounters.  When moving across flat land or walking, the CLIMBER plods forward on it's two large legs, and is able to  conform or step around most small obstacles. The climber can traverse grades of up to 40 percent safely on foot,  and, by applying it's 'third arm' to the task it may climb up and down sheer rock faces and even under rock  overhangs.  Inside, the one humanoid occupant is situated in a cushioned harness which protects him from damage should the  climber fall over and also to allow ease of operation. The climber is heat resistant to about 500 degrees Celsius  and pressure and liquid  resistant to 500 Kpa or five atmospheres. The vessel is self contained and contains a 30 hour air ( any vital- gases ) supply, a day of provisions, a waste disposal unit, a first-aid, and a tool kit. Cargo is stowed above  the pilot's head.

### Dolphin
The DOLPHIN is basically a small 8 person submersible that can dive to a depth of 2 kilometers under water or  any liquid of similar density . Two persons are required to pilot the DOLPHIN and the other six are passengers. It  is equipped with two triple jointed manipulator arms and eight pressurized cameras to track their movement. The  DOLPHIN also comes equipped with four hard shell diving suits which are able to stand the pressures of diving at 2  kilometers . The fins at the back of the sub offer a great amount of maneuverability, the wings along the sides also  lend more stability to the craft. The openings in the front of the wings are to allow water to be pulled into the  DOLPHIN's turbines. The water is then forced trough jets in the rear of the ship. Thus moving the DOLPHIN at great  speeds. The speeds listed below are listed for SURface and SUBmerged respectively.

### Excalibur & Osprey
A single pilot fighter craft that can reach three quarters the speed of light conventionally, with a range of 11  billion km per "BATT". Both vehicles have electromagnetic funnels to collect hydrogen from space. The hydrogen is  tunneled in to a fusion reactor and the "BATT" provides the electricity, needed to produce the magnetic bottle, to  contain the reaction. The plasma is then tunneled through the 'engine', located at the top of the ship, where it is  concentrated and released to provide thrust.  With an optional "DELTA WARP" unit the range and speed are unlimited.  This craft is equipped with an escape pod with food, heat and atmosphere for a week.  The escape pod can "DELTA  WARP" to any place in the galaxy. The pod is equipped with a distress beacon that begins transmitting as soon as  the 'WARP' is completed.
