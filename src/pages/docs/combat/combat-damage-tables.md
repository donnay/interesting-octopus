## Damage Tables

### BLADED WEAPONS TABLE # 9      

01-05 (.2,0) A minor bruise 4 cm. long is the result. The affected
 area will be discoloured for 2:10sd days then clear-
 up. No lasting effects or marks.                     

06-10 (.5,0) An intermediate bruise is done to the area.  Minor   
 pain will last for 1:10sd hours and then ease.       
 Discoloured and stiff for 2:10sd days the area will  
      heal with no permanent damage.                       

11-15 (.7,0) A major bruise with minor blood pooling will be      
 present right under the impact area. A minor bruise  
 will spread out around the wound.  The minor bruise  
      will clear-up in 2:10sd days without any permanent   
      effects. The major bruise will only ease after 1:10sd
      weeks and leave a small discolouration.  Through this
      period the area will be stiff.                       

16-20 (.9,1.1) There is a small cut about 1 cm. long that will      
 exhibit minor bleeding. A clot will form in about    
 2:10sd minutes and the wound will heal with little or
      no scaring even without stitches or special first-aid
      techniques.                                          

21-25 (1.5,2.5) A cut 4 cm. long is the damage done. The laceration  
 doesn't penetrate all the layers of skin, and        
 therefore bleeds very little. Special skin fixing    
      techniques will be necessary to re-align skin edges.

26-30 (2.0,3.7) The resulting cut penetrates into the flesh.  Several
 blood vessels have been cut and will bleed moderately
 until an clot forms in 4:10sd minutes.  The cut is 6
      cm. long and will ache if the area in used or stressed
      in an abrupt fashion.                                

31-35 (2.7,4.7) A moderate cut is the result of the attack. 8 cm.    
 long and 2 cm. deep it will bleed severely for 3:10sd
 minutes and require first-aid A.S.A.P. The body part
      will hurt severely for 1:10sd days.                  

36-40 (3.1,5.5) A severe cut is made in this body part disrupting    
 major veins and arteries. Over 8 cm.  long and 3 cm.
 deep it will bleed extremely for 2:10sd rounds then  
      continue severely for another 6:10sd minutes.        

41-45 (3.4,6.1) An extreme cut that penetrates right to the bone.    
 Major veins and arteries are severed. Bleeding and   
 pain will be extreme and lasting for 7:10sd minutes.

46-50 (3.7,6.7) A puncture wound 4 cm. deep is made with minor       
 bleeding for 1:10sd minutes. Pain will be minor if the
 object is left in the wound, if it is pulled out major
      bleeding and severe pain, both lasting for 2:10sd    
      minutes, will result.                                

51-55 (4.1,7.0) The intermediate puncture wound that is made bleeds  
 intermediately and hurts majorly, with bleeding for  
 2:10sd minutes, if the object is left in. Severe pain
      and extreme bleeding lasting for 3:10sd minutes will
      result if the object is removed.                     

56-60 (4.5,7.3) A severe puncture is the result to this body part.   
 There will be severe pain and bleeding if the object
 is left in. These will both increase to extreme if the
      object is removed.  The wound will bleed for 3:10sd  
      minutes if undisturbed and 4:10sd minutes if the     
      object is removed.                                   

61-65 (4.8,7.5) An extreme puncture is made in this body part. There
 will extreme pain and bleeding if the impaling object
 is removed. These will only be severe if the impaling
      object is left in the wound. Bleeding will continue  
      for 4:10sd minutes with the object in the wound and  
      extend to 5:10sd minutes if the object is removed.   

66-70 (5.2,7.6) A small piece of skin and flesh is separated form the
 body. About 2 cm. wide and 5 cm. long it is a major  
 bleeder and hurts intermediately.  See(FIRST-AID) for
      proper treatment procedure.  The wound will bleed for
      5:10sd minutes if treated properly.                  

71-75 (5.7,8.1) A major gouge separates a chuck of tissues 4 cm.  wide
 and almost 10 long. The gouge is a severe bleeder and
 causes extreme pain. The wound will bleed uncontrolled
      for 2:10sd minutes. Then bleed slowly for 4:10sd     
      minutes until it stops completely.                   

76-80 (6.2,8.4) A severe gouge has taken out a chunk of flesh about 5
 cm wide, 8 cm long and 6 cm deep. The implications are
 severe and medical attention must be sought to ensure
      survival. The depth will effect internal organs.     
      Bleeding will continue unabated for 2:10sd days.     

81-85 (6.5,8.6) The extreme gouge done is life-threatening due to the
 large amount of tissues disrupted. About 8 cm wide, 10
 cm long and 8 cm deep it will probably hit bones or  
      internal organs. Bleeding will continue until death if
      treatment is not obtained.                           

86-90 (6.9,8.8) A simple oblique fracture to the bone in this body   
 part is the damage done by the attack. Some internal
 bleeding will occur and swelling result but the      
      effects of the cut will far outweigh those of the    
      break. The pain will be moderate for 3:10sd hours then
      taper to minor for the duration of the healing       
      process. If no bones: read the AD description(s)     
      omitting the bone references.                        

91-95 (7.6,9.2) A compound shatter fracture is the result to the bone
 in this area. Now the bone has also broken the skin  
 and will be adding to the blood loss from the initial
      laceration.  If no bones: read the AD description(s)
      omitting the bone references.                        

96-00 (8.2,9.6) If two bones: they have both been broken in one place
 and fracture is a simple one. The pain will be severe
 for 3:10sd hours then taper off to moderate for the  
      duration of the healing process.  If one bone: it is
      totally shattered and will not knit properly unless  
      medical treatment is sought. The pain will be extreme
      due to the total ripping apart of the bone. 4:10sd   
      hours of extreme and 2:10sd days of severe pain. If no
      bones: read the AD description(s) omitting the bone  
      references.                                          


### PROJECTILE WEAPONS TABLE # 10  

01-05 (.1,.2) A minor bruise (4 cm.) is the result. The affected
 area will be discoloured for 2:10sd days then clear
 up. There will be no lasting effects or marks.  

06-10 (.4,.8) A severe bruise with minor blood pooling will be
 present right under the impact area. A minor bruise
 will spread out around the wound.  The minor bruise
      will clear up in 1:10sd days without any permanent
      effects. The major bruise will only ease after 2:10sd
      days and leave a small discolouration.  Through this
      period the area will be stiff.               

11-15 (1.0,1.2) Minor jagged cut 4 cm. long. If wound is held together
 with butterfly bandages the scaring the results will
 be minimized. It will bleed for 1:10sd minutes then a
      scab will form to stop the bleeding.                 

16-20 (1.8,1.7) A moderate cut with jagged edges is the damage done to
 this body part. Small minor scrapes surround the    
 wound. Which will be stiff and hard to move for 1:10sd
      days and bleed moderately for 2:10sd minutes.         

21-25 (2.6,2.4) The minor puncture 2 cm. deep has effected several
 minor blood vessels in this.  Intermediate bleeding
 and pain will accompany the puncture and last for
      3:10sd minutes. The limb or body part will be stiff
      and hard to move for 3:10 days.  

26-30 (3.2,2.9) An intermediate puncture that severs major bloods
 vessels and is 4 cm. deep is the damage done.  
 Moderate bleeding will be present with pain throbbing
      form moderate to heavy. These will last for 4:10sd
      minutes and 2:10sd hours respectively.             

31-35 (3.6,3.4) A heavy puncture is done. It cuts multiple major blood
 vessels causing heavy bleeding and pain throbbing
 between heavy and severe. The pain will continue for
      3:10 sd hours and the bleeding will ease in 5:10sd
      minutes.                 

36-40 (3.9,3.8) A severe puncture is the result of the attack.  It
 rips open a large portion of skin 8 cm. in diametre
 exposing 2 cm˝ of internal organs or bones. The
      implication are life-threatening if no medical
      attention is sought.  

41-45 (4.5,4.1) The projectile has gone clear through up 10 cm.  of
 flesh leaving a large exit hole and ripping out a
 large chunk of flesh. The pain will be severe
      throbbing to extreme and lasting 4:10sd minutes. The
      bleeding is severe and will last for 7:10sd minutes.  
      If there is more than 10 cm. of flesh the projectile
      is still lodged in the flesh and should be removed.  

46-50 (5.5,5.3) Minor tendon damage with heavy pain severe blood loss.
 swelling will occur and the area will be very       
 sensitive to pressure either from use or an accidental
      bump. The swelling will last 3:10sd days while the  
      pain will disappear in just 2:10sd hours.            

51-55 (5.8,5.1) Intermediate tendon damage and minor ligament damage
 (if applicable). Again swelling in 2:10sd minutes if
 untreated lasting 3:10sd hours. In this case the
      swelling will be severe if untreated and minor if
      treated. The pain will be much shorter-lived then the
      swelling lasting about 1:10sd+5 hours.      

56-60 (6.1,5.6) Severe tendon damage and heavy ligament damage is done
 (if applicable) by the attack. Swelling will be      
 intermediate if treated extreme otherwise. Beginning
      in 1:10sd minutes and lasting 4:10sd hours. Inter
      mediate pain for 1:10sd hours.  

61-65 (6.5,6.1) Simple hair-line fracture of the bone present in this
 body part. The projectile skimmed off the bone.  The
 body part will be almost impossible to use and give
      heavy pain if weight is placed on it. The pain and  
      swelling will subside after 1:10sd+5 and 4:10sd + 5
      hours respectively. If no bones: read the AD     
      description(s) omitting the bone references.  

66-70 (7.2,6.3) Simple oblique fracture of the bone. If weight or
 pressure is placed on this body part heavy bleeding
 will occur and if not treated will become severe. This
      body part will swell for 4:10sd+10 hours and be
      extremely painful for 1:10sd+10 hrs.  If no bones:
      read the AD description(s) as normal but exclude any
      bone references.                  

71-75 (7.8,6.7) Simple shatter fracture, the bullet was stopped by the
 bone. There will be a grinding sensation if the body
 part is moved and 10% of the damage is re-inflicted
      upon moving the body part. This body part will swell
      for 5:10sd hours and the injured person will       
      experience extreme pain for 1:10sd hrs. and swelling
      for 6:10sd hours. If no bones: read the AD          
      description(s) omitting the bone references.  

76-80 (8.4,7.5) Compound oblique fracture of the bone. A major blood
 vessel is severed and severe bleeding will occur for
 5:10sd minutes. Swelling will continue for 1:10sd days
      and the body part(s) below a wounded limb will suffer
      2 pts. of damage for every minute that the wound is
      un-treated and blood flow in not restored.  10% more
      damage is inflicted if the part is moved.  If no    
      bones: read the AD description(s) as normal but   
      exclude any bone references.      

81-85 (8.7,7.8) A minor compound shatter fracture of the bone. A major
 blood vessel is crushed and another is severed. Heavy
 bleeding present for 5:10sd minutes.  Stiffness and
      swelling for 1:10sd days and severe pain for 8:10sd
      hours. The body parts below the injury will suffer
      1:10sd pts. of damage for every minute that the wound
      is untreated and blood flow is interrupted. If no   
      bones: read the AD description(s) omitting the bone
      references.                    

86-90 (9.2,8.0) A severe compound shatter fracture of the bone in this
 body part. The major blood vessels in this area have
 been punctured by the bone fragments.  Uncontrolled
      Bleeding for 1:10sd minutes. then ease to moderate but
      not stop without treatment. No weight or pressure
      should be placed on the body part or extreme pain will
      result. The flesh below the wound will suffer 1:10ds+5
      damage pts. per minute it is left untreated. If no  
      bones: read the AD description(s) omitting the bone
      references.                                   

91-95 (9.6,8.5) If two bones in area: Both bones are broken roll on
 table to see what kind of fracture and tissue damage
 has resulted. If one bone: The bone is shattered
      completely along it's length. It cannot be used for
      movement at all, because no weight can place on the
      bone. If no bones: read the AD description(s) as
      normal but exclude any bone references.  

96-00 (9.9,8.9) If three bones: All three have been broken roll on the
 bone damage table to determine what kinds of fractures
 and read description above. If two bones: One is    
      shattered the other has a fracture roll on bone damage
      table. If one bone: The bone is totally shattered even
      up to the joints. No way to salvage the bone. If no
      bones: read the AD description(s) omitting the bone
      references.                    


### PHOTON and PARTICLE ACCELERATORS +  BURNING WEAPONS TABLE # 11  

01-05 (.6,0) Redness to skin but no penetration at all into skin.  
 The area will feel warn to the touch and be sensitive
 to pressure for ´:10sd hours. These will be the only
      effects and they are only temporary.              

06-10 (1.1,0) Irritation of the skin in the effected area is
 apparent by severe skin redness and minor swelling.  
 The area will be sensitive to pressure and feel warn
      for 1:10sd hours. No permanent effects or marks.  

11-15 (1.9,.2) Severe redness and intermediate swelling. There is a
 60 percent chance of ´:10sd blisters up to 2 cm in
 diametre. The skin will be extremely sensitive to
      heat, cold, touch and pressure for 3:10sd hours. The
      blisters will not cause scars and therefore there are
      no permanent effects.  Pain will be moderate for 1:10
      sd hours the taper off.       

16-20 (2.1,.7) Redness will be extreme and severe swelling is
 noticeable. There is an 80 percent chance of 1:10sd
 blisters up to 3 cm in diametre.  Sensitivity to any
      kind of stimulation will be severe for 1:10sd days and
      minor for an additional 2:10sd days. If the blisters
      are lanced some scaring may occur. Heavy pain with
      this burn lasting for 2:10sd hours.            

21-25 (2.7,1.2) Blisters now cover a 5 cm˝ area and the skin appears
 wet and sticky. The blisters are filled with fluid and
 can be lanced easily. If they are lanced (see FIRST-
      AID) for additions to "INFECTION". These blisters will
      last for 1:10sd days and be followed by peeling skin
      for an additional 1:10sd days.  Scaring will be minor
      if the blisters are lanced and unnoticeable if they  
      are not. Pain will be severe for 3:10sd hours then
      minor for 1:10sd more hours.                        

26-30 (3.2,1.7) Blisters now cover 20 cm˝ of skin. The area is covered
 in a thin layer of clear viscous fluid. The severity
 and depth of the burn will increase toward the centre.
      The same note for the blisters as above.  Extreme pain
      and sensitivity will last for 3:10sd hours then reduce
      to heavy for 2:10sd hours and finally to minor for
      1:10sd hours.                       

31-35 (3.7,2.2) A small area 3 cm˝ will be white and chared.  There
 will be little or no pain form the chared area.
 Bleeding will also be minimal.  All the layers of skin
      will be burnt away in the white area.          

36-40 (4.1,2.6) The white and chared area is now 5 cm˝. Again the pain
 and bleeding will be small in comparison to other
 wounds. This is due to the cauterizing heat.        

41-45 (4.4,3.0) The burn extends below the skin into the soft tissues
 of this body part. These tissues were heated so quick
 that they have suffered some minor ripping.  The      
      tissues are spread away from the impact point and have
      separated from the other layers of flesh.  The loose
      ends are now sticking up. Bleeding is minor and lasts
      for ´:10sd minutes but the pain will be light or     
      1:10sd minutes.              

46-50 (4.8,3.4) The minor puncture 2 cm. deep has effected several
 minor blood vessels in this body part.  The ripping-up
 of flesh is moderate and causes intermediate bleeding
      and pain for 3:10sd minutes. The limb or body part
      will be stiff to move for 3:10 days.            

51-55 (5.3,3.8) An intermediate puncture that rips open major bloods
 vessels is the damage done and is 4 cm. deep.  
 Moderate bleeding will be present with pain throbbing
      from moderate to heavy. These will last for 4:10sd
      minutes and 2:10sd hours respectively.             

56-60 (6.0,4.3) A heavy puncture is done. The ripping is 6 cm deep and
 severs multiple major blood vessels causing heavy
 bleeding and pain throbbing between heavy and severe.
      The pain will continue for 3:10sd hours and the     
      bleeding will ease in 5:10sd minutes.      

61-65 (6.4,4.8) A severe puncture is the result of the attack. It rips
 open a large portion of skin 8 cm˝ in diameter      
 exposing 2 cm˝ of internal organs or bones. The
      implications are life-threatening if no medical
      attention is sought. Bleeding and pain will continue
      for 7:10sd minutes and 5:10sd hours respectively. Ifno
      bones: read the AD description(s) omitting the bone
      references.       

66-70 (6.7,5.3) All the tissues above the bone will now be burnt away
 and the exposed surface of the bone will be scorched.
 6 cm˝ of the bone will be exposed.  White chared
      portions of flesh surround the exposed bone to a    
      diametre of 5 cm.  If no bones: read the AD        
      description(s) omitting the bone references.     

71-75 (7.1,5.7) 15 cm˝ of the bone has now been exposed and at least
 half of all the tissues in the body part have been  
 affected. The chared area is larger now and the bone
      is almost pitch black. If no bones: read the AD   
      description(s) omitting the bone refernces.     

76-80 (7.3,6.1) The excessive heat causes hair-line cracks in the bone
 in this area. The limb is now totally useless due to
 almost total muscle destruction.  Moderate bleeding
      will be limited to the outer surrounding tissues.  If
      no bones: read the AD description(s) as normal but  
      exclude any bone references.             

81-85 (7.9,6.6) The exposed bone breaks and cracks. The bone has a
 compound oblique fracture and small areas of a shatter
 fracture. Black fluid will ooze out of the crack. This
      fluid is bone marrow that has been cooked by the
      blast.  If no bones: read the AD description(s)
      omitting the bone references.                 

86-90 (8.3,7.1) A compound shatter fracture of the bone in this body
 part. The major blood vessels in this area have been
 punctured by the bone fragments.  Bleeding is minimal
      due to the heat and its cauterizing effect.  No weight
      or pressure can be placed on the body part or extreme
      pain will result. The flesh below the wound will
      suffer 1:10ds+5 damage pts. per minute it is left   
      untreated. If no bones: read the AD description(s)
      omitting the bone references.                 

91-95 (8.7,7.6) If two bones in area: Both bones are broken roll on
 table to see what kind of fracture and tissue damage
 has resulted. If one bone: The bone is shattered
      completely along it's length. It cannot be used for
      movement at all, because no weight can place on the
      bone. If no bones: read the AD description(s) as
      normal but exclude any bone references.  

96-00 (9.2,8.2) If three bones: All three have been broken roll on the
 bone damage table to determine what kinds of fractures
 and read description above. If two bones: One is    
      shattered the other has a fracture roll on bone damage
      table. If one bone: The bone is totally shattered even
      up to the joints. No way to salvage the bone. If no
      bones: read the AD description(s) omitting the bone
      references.                    


### BLUDGEONING WEAPONS TABLE # 12                                 

01-05 (0,0) A minor bruise 4 cm. long is the result. The affected
 area will be discoloured for ´:10sd days then clear-
 up. No lasting effects or marks.             

06-10 (.3,0) The resulting scrape is minor and affects an area of
 only 4 cm˝. The uppermost layer of skin is affected an
 it is not torn or ripped merely rubbed or scraped off.
      The are will appear red and be barely painful for

 affected. The chared area is larger now and the bone
      is almost pitch black. If no bones in area: read the
      AD description(s) omitting bone references.          

76-80 (7.8,6.1) The excessive heat causes hair-line cracks in the bone
 in this area. The limb is now totally useless due to
 almost total muscle destruction. Moderate bleeding   
      will be limited to the outer surrounding tissues. If
      no bones in area: read the AD description(s) omitting
      the bone references.                                 

81-85 (8.3,6.7) The exposed bone breaks and cracks. The bone has a   
 compound oblique fracture and small areas of a shatter
 fracture. Black fluid will ooze out of the crack. This
      fluid is bone marrow that has been cooked by the     
      blast. If no bones in area: read the AD description(s)
      omitting the bone references.                        

86-90 (8.7,7.3) A compound shatter fracture of the bone in this body
 part. The major blood vessels in this area have been
 punctured by the bone fragments. Bleeding is minimal
      due to the heat and its cauterizing effect.  No weight
      or pressure can be placed on the body part or extreme
      pain will result. The flesh below the wound will     
      suffer 1:10ds+5 damage pts. per minute it is left    
      untreated. If no bones in area: read the AD          
      description(s) omitting the bone references.         

91-95 (9.1,7.8) If two bones in area : Both bones are broken roll on
 table to see what kind of fracture and tissue damage
 has resulted. If one bone in area: The bone is       
      shattered completely along it's length. It cannot be
      used for movement at all, because no weight can place
      on the bone. If no bones in area: read the AD        
      description(s) omitting the bone references.         

96-00 (9.7,8.3) If three bones in area: All three have been broken   
 roll on the bone damage table to determine what kinds
 of fractures and read description above.  If two bones
      in area: One is shattered the other has a fracture   
      roll on bone damage table. If one bone in area: The  
      bone is totally shattered even up to the joints. No  
      way to salvage the bone. If no bones in area: read the
      AD description(s) as normal but exclude any bone     
      references.                                          



### EXPLOSIVE WEAPONS  TABLE 15

01-05 (0,0) An intermediate bruise is done to the area.  Minor   
 pain will last for 1:10sd hours and then ease.       
 Discoloured and stiff for 2:10sd days the area will  
      heal with no permanent damage.                       

06-10 (0,0) A major bruise with minor blood pooling will be      
 present right under the impact area. A minor bruise  
 will spread out around the wound. The minor bruise   
      will clear-up in 2:10sd days without any permanent   
      effects. The major bruise will only ease after 1:10sd
      weeks and leave a small discolouration.  Through this
      period the area will be stiff.                       

11-15 (.5,.1) The resulting scrape is minor and affects an area of
 only 4 cm˝. The uppermost layer of skin is affected an
 it is not torn or ripped merely rubbed or scraped off.
      The are will appear red and be barely painful for    
      1:10sd days. There will be no lasting effects.       

16-20 (1.1,.8) The moderate scrape done to this body part is 8 cm˝ in
 area and now involves the upper three layers of skin.
 These layers have all been rubbed off in the affected
      area. Surrounding the wound there is a minor scrape. A
      thin scab will form to aid healing but it is very    
      fragile. The wound will heal in 2:10sd days if kept  
      clean.  Pain will be minor an some stiffness may     
      accompany the injury.                                

21-25 (1.8,1.5) Major scraping is the damage done to this body part.
 All the layers of skin are now effected and may be   
 rubbed off or a flap of skin may have been pulled up.

      continue severely for another 6:10sd minutes.        

31-35 (3.2,2.9) An extreme cut that penetrates right to the bone.    
 Major veins and arteries are severed. The bleeding and
 pain will be extreme and continue for 7:10sd minutes.
      A minor gouge is done to the body part.              

36-40 (3.9,3.6) A severe puncture is the result to this body part.   
 There will be severe pain and bleeding if the object
 is left in. These will both increase to extreme if the
      object is removed. The wound will bleed for 3:10sd   
      minutes if undisturbed and 4:10sd minutes if the     
      object is removed.                                   

41-45 (4.6,4.3) An extreme puncture is made in this body part.  There
 will extreme pain and bleeding if the impaling object
 is removed. These will only be severe if the impaling
      object is left in the wound. Bleeding will continue  
      for 4:10sd minutes with the object in the wound and  
      extend to 5:10sd minutes if the object is removed.   

46-50 (5.2,5.0) Simple hair-line fracture of the bone present in this
 body part. The projectile skimmed off the bone.  The
 body part will be almost impossible to use and give  
      heavy pain if weight is placed on it. The pain and   
      swelling will subside after 1:10sd+5 and 4:10sd + 5  
      hours respectively. If no bones in area: read the ADD
      description(s) as normal but exclude any bone

 pressure is placed on this body part heavy bleeding  
 will occur and if not treated will become severe.    
      This body part will swell for 4:10sd+10 hours and be
      extremely painful for 1:10sd+10 hrs. If no bones in  
      area: read the ADD description(s) as normal but      
      exclude any bone references.

 bone. There will be a grinding sensation if the body
 part is moved and 10% of the damage is re-inflicted  
      upon moving the body part. This body part will swell
      for 5:10sd hours and the injured person will         
      experience extreme pain for 1:10sd hrs. and swelling
      for 6:10sd hours. If no bones in area: read the ADD  
      description(s) omitting the bone references.

 vessel is severed and severe bleeding will occur for
 5:10sd minutes. Swelling will continue for 1:10sd days
      and the body part(s) below a wounded limb will suffer
      2 pts. of damage for every minute that the wound is  
      un-treated and blood flow in not restored.  10% more
      damage is inflicted if the part is moved.  If no bones
      in area: read the ADD description(s) as normal but   
      exclude any bone references.
