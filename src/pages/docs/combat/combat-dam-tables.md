##9 -  Bladed Weapons

| % Damage | Severity Roll | Damage Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| 01-05 | (.2,0) | A minor bruise 4 cm. long is the result. The affected area will be discoloured for 2:10sd days then clear- up. No lasting effects or marks. |
| 06-10 | (.5,0) | An intermediate bruise is done to the area. Minor pain will last for 1:10sd hours and then ease. Discoloured and stiff for 2:10sd days the area will  heal with no permanent damage. |
| 11-15 | (.7,0) | A major bruise with minor blood pooling will be present right under the impact area. A minor bruise will spread out around the wound. The minor bruise will clear-up in 2:10sd days without any permanent effects. The major bruise will only ease after 1:10sd weeks and leave a small discolouration. Through this period the area will be stiff. |
| 16-20 | (.9,1.1) | There is a small cut about 1 cm. long that will exhibit minor bleeding. A clot will form in about 2:10sd minutes and the wound will heal with little or no scaring even without stitches or special first-aid techniques. |
| 21-25 | (1.5,2.5) | A cut 4 cm. long is the damage done. The laceration doesn't penetrate all the layers of skin, and therefore bleeds very little. Special skin fixing techniques will be necessary to re-align skin edges. |
| 26-30 | (2.0,3.7) | The resulting cut penetrates into the flesh. Several blood vessels have been cut and will bleed moderately until an clot forms in 4:10sd minutes. The cut is 6 cm. long and will ache if the area in used or stressed in an abrupt fashion. |
| 31-35 | (2.7,4.7) | A moderate cut is the result of the attack. 8 cm. long and 2 cm. deep it will bleed severely for 3:10sd minutes and require first-aid A.S.A.P. The body part will hurt severely for 1:10sd days. |
| 36-40 | (3.1,5.5) | A severe cut is made in this body part disrupting major veins and arteries. Over 8 cm. long and 3 cm. deep it will bleed extremely for 2:10sd rounds then continue severely for another 6:10sd minutes. |
| 41-45 | (3.4,6.1) | An extreme cut that penetrates right to the bone. Major veins and arteries are severed. Bleeding and pain will be extreme and lasting for 7:10sd minutes. |
| 46-50 | (3.7,6.7) | A puncture wound 4 cm. deep is made with minor bleeding for 1:10sd minutes. Pain will be minor if the object is left in the wound, if it is pulled out major bleeding and severe pain, both lasting for 2:10sd minutes, will result. |
| 51-55 | (4.1,7.0) | The intermediate puncture wound that is made bleeds intermediately and hurts majorly, with bleeding for 2:10sd minutes, if the object is left in. Severe pain and extreme bleeding lasting for 3:10sd minutes will result if the object is removed. |
| 56-60 | (4.5,7.3) | A severe puncture is the result to this body part. There will be severe pain and bleeding if the object is left in. These will both increase to extreme if the object is removed. The wound will bleed for 3:10sd minutes if undisturbed and 4:10sd minutes if the object is removed. |
| 61-65 | (4.8,7.5) | An extreme puncture is made in this body part. There will extreme pain and bleeding if the impaling object is removed. These will only be severe if the impaling object is left in the wound. Bleeding will continue for 4:10sd minutes with the object in the wound and extend to 5:10sd minutes if the object is removed. |
| 66-70 | (5.2,7.6) | A small piece of skin and flesh is separated form the body. About 2 cm. wide and 5 cm. long it is a major bleeder and hurts intermediately. See(FIRST-AID) | for proper treatment procedure. The wound will bleed for 5:10sd minutes if treated properly. |
| 71-75 | (5.7,8.1) | A major gouge separates a chuck of tissues 4 cm. wide and almost 10 long. The gouge is a severe bleeder and causes extreme pain. The wound will bleed uncontrolled for 2:10sd minutes. Then bleed slowly for 4:10sd minutes until it stops completely. |
| 76-80 | (6.2,8.4) | A severe gouge has taken out a chunk of flesh about 5 cm wide, 8 cm long and 6 cm deep. The implications are severe and medical attention must be sought to ensure survival. The depth will effect internal organs. Bleeding will continue unabated for 2:10sd days. |
| 81-85 | (6.5,8.6) | The extreme gouge done is life-threatening due to the large amount of tissues disrupted. About 8 cm wide, 10 cm long and 8 cm deep it will probably hit bones or internal organs. Bleeding will continue until death if treatment is not obtained. |
| 86-90 | (6.9,8.8) | A simple oblique fracture to the bone in this body part is the damage done by the attack. Some internal bleeding will occur and swelling result but the effects of the cut will far outweigh those of the break. The pain will be moderate for 3:10sd hours then taper to minor for the duration of the healing process. If no bones: read the AD description(s) | omitting the bone references. |
| 91-95 | (7.6,9.2) | A compound shatter fracture is the result to the bone in this area. Now the bone has also broken the skin and will be adding to the blood loss from the initial laceration. If no bones: read the AD description(s) | omitting the bone references. |
| 96-00 | (8.2,9.6) | If two bones: they have both been broken in one place and fracture is a simple one. The pain will be severe for 3:10sd hours then taper off to moderate for the duration of the healing process. If one bone: it is totally shattered and will not knit properly unless medical treatment is sought. The pain will be extreme due to the total ripping apart of the bone. 4:10sd hours of extreme and 2:10sd days of severe pain. If no bones: read the AD description(s) | omitting the bone references. |

| 36-40 | (3.9,3.8) | A severe puncture is the result of the attack. It rips open a large portion of skin 8 cm. in diametre exposing 2 cmÀù of internal organs or bones. The implication are life-threatening if no medical attention is sought.|
| 41-45 | (4.5,4.1) | The projectile has gone clear through up 10 cm. of flesh leaving a large exit hole and ripping out a large chunk of flesh. The pain will be severe throbbing to extreme and lasting 4:10sd minutes. The bleeding is severe and will last for 7:10sd minutes. If there is more than 10 cm. of flesh the projectile is still lodged in the flesh and should be removed.|
| 46-50 | (5.5,5.3) | Minor tendon damage with heavy pain severe blood loss. swelling will occur and the area will be very sensitive to pressure either from use or an accidental bump. The swelling will last 3:10sd days while the pain will disappear in just 2:10sd hours.|

##11 -  Photon and Particle Accelerators + Burning Weapons
| % Damage | Severity Roll | Damage Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| 01-05 | (.6,0) | Redness to skin but no penetration at all into skin. The area will feel warn to the touch and be sensitive to pressure for ¬¥:10sd hours. These will be the only effects and they are only temporary. |
| 06-10 | (1.1,0) | Irritation of the skin in the effected area is apparent by severe skin redness and minor swelling. The area will be sensitive to pressure and feel warn for 1:10sd hours. No permanent effects or marks. |
| 11-15 | (1.9,.2) |  Severe redness and intermediate swelling. There is a 60 percent chance of ¬¥:10sd blisters up to 2 cm in diametre. The skin will be extremely sensitive to heat, cold, touch and pressure for 3:10sd hours. The blisters will not cause scars and therefore there are no permanent effects. Pain will be moderate for 1:10 sd hours the taper off. |
| 16-20 | (2.1,.7) | Redness will be extreme and severe swelling is noticeable. There is an 80 percent chance of 1:10sd blisters up to 3 cm in diametre. Sensitivity to any kind of stimulation will be severe for 1:10sd days and minor for an additional 2:10sd days. If the blisters are lanced some scaring may occur. Heavy pain with this burn lasting for 2:10sd hours.|
| 21-25 | (2.7,1.2) |  Blisters now cover a 5 cmÀù area and the skin appears wet and sticky. The blisters are filled with fluid and can be lanced easily. If they are lanced (see FIRST- AID) | for additions to "INFECTION". These blisters will last for 1:10sd days and be followed by peeling skin for an additional 1:10sd days. Scaring will be minor if the blisters are lanced and unnoticeable if they are not. Pain will be severe for 3:10sd hours then minor for 1:10sd more hours. |
| 26-30 | (3.2,1.7) |  Blisters now cover 20 cmÀù of skin. The area is covered in a thin layer of clear viscous fluid. The severity and depth of the burn will increase toward the centre. The same note for the blisters as above. Extreme pain and sensitivity will last for 3:10sd hours then reduce to heavy for 2:10sd hours and finally to minor for 1:10sd hours. |
| 31-35 | (3.7,2.2) | A small area 3 cmÀù will be white and chared. There will be little or no pain form the chared area. Bleeding will also be minimal. All the layers of skin will be burnt away in the white area. |
| 36-40 | (4.1,2.6) | The white and chared area is now 5 cmÀù. Again the pain and bleeding will be small in comparison to other wounds. This is due to the cauterizing heat. |
| 41-45 | (4.4,3.0) |  The burn extends below the skin into the soft tissues of this body part. These tissues were heated so quick that they have suffered some minor ripping. The tissues are spread away from the impact point and have separated from the other layers of flesh. The loose ends are now sticking up.

The pain will continue for 3:10sd hours and the bleeding will ease in 5:10sd minutes. |
| 61-65 | (6.4,4.8) |  A severe puncture is the result of the attack. It rips open a large portion of skin 8 cmÀù in diameter exposing 2 cmÀù of internal organs or bones. The implications are life-threatening if no medical attention is sought. Bleeding and pain will continue for 7:10sd minutes and 5:10sd hours respectively. Ifno bones: read the AD description(s) | omitting the bone references. |
| 66-70 | (6.7,5.3) | All the tissues above the bone will now be burnt away and the exposed surface of the bone will be scorched. 6 cmÀù of the bone will be exposed. White chared portions of flesh surround the exposed bone to a diametre of 5 cm. If no bones: read the AD description(s) | omitting the bone references. |
| 71-75 | (7.1,5.7) | 15 cmÀù of the bone has now been exposed and at least half of all the tissues in the body part have been affected. The chared area is larger now and the bone is almost pitch black. If no bones: read the AD description(s) | omitting the bone refernces. |
| 76-80 | (7.3,6.1) | The excessive heat causes hair-line cracks in the bone in this area. The limb is now totally useless due to almost total muscle destruction. Moderate bleeding will be limited to the outer surrounding tissues. If no bones: read the AD description(s) | as normal but exclude any bone references. |
| 81-85 | (7.9,6.6) | The exposed bone breaks and cracks. The bone has a compound oblique fracture and small areas of a shatter fracture. Black fluid will ooze out of the crack. This fluid is bone marrow that has been cooked by the blast. If no bones: read the AD description(s) | omitting the bone references.|
| 86-90 | (8.3,7.1) | A compound shatter fracture of the bone in this body part. The major blood vessels in this area have been punctured by the bone fragments. Bleeding is minimal due to the heat and its cauterizing effect. No weight or pressure can be placed on the body part or extreme pain will result. The flesh below the wound will suffer 1:10ds+5 damage pts. per minute it is left untreated. If no bones: read the AD description(s) | omitting the bone references. |
| 91-95 | (8.7,7.6) |  If two bones in area: Both bones are broken roll on table to see what kind of fracture and tissue damage has resulted. If one bone: The bone is shattered completely along it's length. It cannot be used for movement at all, because no weight can place on the bone.
