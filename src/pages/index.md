    content: >-
      Literally hundreds of societies live under the Foundation, and each has its own distinct sense of value and worth,  thus making it extremely difficult to reach even a general consensus on a standard system of monetary exchange. The  traditions and customs that have arisen within one people may hold totally different or even opposite meanings for their  neighbours, whether they be a few kilometres or a few parsecs distant.
