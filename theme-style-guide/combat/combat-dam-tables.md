 **Note:** When directed to read the AD descriptions, read the damage description indicated by the plus '➕' symbol in addition to the damage description obtained by roll.

 \#\#8 - Bladed Weapons \| % Damage \| Severity Roll \| Damage Description \| \|----:\|----:\|-----\| \| 01-05 \| \(.2,0\) \| A minor bruise 4 cm. long is the result. The affected area will be discoloured for 2:10sd days then clear- up. No lasting effects or marks. \| \| 06-10 \| \(.5,0\) \| An intermediate bruise is done to the area. Minor pain will last for 1:10sd hours and then ease. Discoloured and stiff for 2:10sd days the area will heal with no permanent damage. \| \| ➕ 11-15 \| \(.7,0\) \| A major bruise with minor blood pooling will be present right under the impact area. A minor bruise will spread out around the wound. The minor bruise will clear-up in 2:10sd days without any permanent effects. The major bruise will only ease after 1:10sd weeks and leave a small discolouration. Through this period the area will be stiff. \| \| 16-20 \| \(.9,1.1\) \| There is a small cut about 1 cm. long that will exhibit minor bleeding. A clot will form in about 2:10sd minutes and the wound will heal with little or no scaring even without stitches or special first-aid techniques. \| \| 21-25 \| \(1.5,2.5\) \| A cut 4 cm. long is the damage done. The laceration doesn't penetrate all the layers of skin, and therefore bleeds very little. Special skin fixing techniques will be necessary to re-align skin edges. \| \| 26-30 \| \(2.0,3.7\) \| The resulting cut penetrates into the flesh. Several blood vessels have been cut and will bleed moderately until an clot forms in 4:10sd minutes. The cut is 6 cm. long and will ache if the area in used or stressed in an abrupt fashion. \| \| 31-35 \| \(2.7,4.7\) \| A moderate cut is the result of the attack. 8 cm. long and 2 cm. deep it will bleed severely for 3:10sd minutes and require first-aid A.S.A.P. The body part will hurt severely for 1:10sd days. \| \| 36-40 \| \(3.1,5.5\) \| A severe cut is made in this body part disrupting major veins and arteries. Over 8 cm. long and 3 cm. deep it will bleed extremely for 2:10sd rounds then continue severely for another 6:10sd minutes. \| \| ➕ 41-45 \| \(3.4,6.1\) \| An extreme cut that penetrates right to the bone. Major veins and arteries are severed. Bleeding and pain will be extreme and lasting for 7:10sd minutes. \| \| 46-50 \| \(3.7,6.7\) \| A puncture wound 4 cm. deep is made with minor bleeding for 1:10sd minutes. Pain will be minor if the object is left in the wound, if it is pulled out major bleeding and severe pain, both lasting for 2:10sd minutes, will result. \| \| 51-55 \| \(4.1,7.0\) \| The intermediate puncture wound that is made bleeds intermediately and hurts majorly, with bleeding for 2:10sd minutes, if the object is left in. Severe pain and extreme bleeding lasting for 3:10sd minutes will result if the object is removed. \| \| 56-60 \| \(4.5,7.3\) \| A severe puncture is the result to this body part. There will be severe pain and bleeding if the object is left in. These will both increase to extreme if the object is removed. The wound will bleed for 3:10sd minutes if undisturbed and 4:10sd minutes if the object is removed. \| \| 61-65 \| \(4.8,7.5\) \| An extreme puncture is made in this body part. There will extreme pain and bleeding if the impaling object is removed. These will only be severe if the impaling object is left in the wound. Bleeding will continue for 4:10sd minutes with the object in the wound and extend to 5:10sd minutes if the object is removed. \| \| 66-70 \| \(5.2,7.6\) \| A small piece of skin and flesh is separated form the body. About 2 cm. wide and 5 cm. long it is a major bleeder and hurts intermediately. See\( \[FIRST-AID\]\(/docs/character-life/character-life/\#categories\_of\_treatment\)\) for proper treatment procedure. The wound will bleed for 5:10sd minutes if treated properly. \| \| 71-75 \| \(5.7,8.1\) \| A major gouge separates a chuck of tissues 4 cm. wide and almost 10 long. The gouge is a severe bleeder and causes extreme pain. The wound will bleed uncontrolled for 2:10sd minutes. Then bleed slowly for 4:10sd minutes until it stops completely. \| \| 76-80 \| \(6.2,8.4\) \| A severe gouge has taken out a chunk of flesh about 5 cm wide, 8 cm long and 6 cm deep. The implications are severe and medical attention must be sought to ensure survival. The depth will effect internal organs. Bleeding will continue unabated for 2:10sd days. \| \| ➕ 81-85 \| \(6.5,8.6\) \| The extreme gouge done is life-threatening due to the large amount of tissues disrupted. About 8 cm wide, 10 cm long and 8 cm deep it will probably hit bones or internal organs. Bleeding will continue until death if treatment is not obtained. \| \| 86-90 \| \(6.9,8.8\) \| A simple oblique fracture to the bone in this body part is the damage done by the attack. Some internal bleeding will occur and swelling result but the effects of the cut will far outweigh those of the break. The pain will be moderate for 3:10sd hours then taper to minor for the duration of the healing process. If no bones: read the AD description\(s\) \| omitting the bone references. \| \| 91-95 \| \(7.6,9.2\) \| A compound shatter fracture is the result to the bone in this area. Now the bone has also broken the skin and will be adding to the blood loss from the initial laceration. If no bones: read the AD description\(s\) \| omitting the bone references. \| \| 96-00 \| \(8.2,9.6\) \| If two bones: they have both been broken in one place and fracture is a simple one. The pain will be severe for 3:10sd hours then taper off to moderate for the duration of the healing process. If one bone: it is totally shattered and will not knit properly unless medical treatment is sought. The pain will be extreme due to the total ripping apart of the bone. 4:10sd hours of extreme and 2:10sd days of severe pain. If no bones: read the AD description\(s\) \| omitting the bone references. \| \#\#9 - Projectile Weapons \| % Damage \| Severity Roll \| Damage Description \| \|----:\|----:\|-----\| \| 01-05 \| \(.1,.2\) \| A minor bruise \(4 cm.\) \| is the result.

There will be no lasting effects or marks.\| \| ➕ 06-10 \| \(.4,.8\) \| A severe bruise with minor blood pooling will be present right under the impact area. A minor bruise will spread out around the wound. The minor bruise will clear up in 1:10sd days without any permanent effects. The major bruise will only ease after 2:10sd days and leave a small discolouration. Through this period the area will be stiff.\| \| 11-15 \| \(1.0,1.2\) \| Minor jagged cut 4 cm. long. If wound is held together with butterfly bandages the scaring the results will be minimized. It will bleed for 1:10sd minutes then a scab will form to stop the bleeding.\| \| 16-20 \| \(1.8,1.7\) \| A moderate cut with jagged edges is the damage done to this body part. Small minor scrapes surround the wound. Which will be stiff and hard to move for 1:10sd days and bleed moderately for 2:10sd minutes.\| \| ➕ 21-25 \| \(2.6,2.4\) \| The minor puncture 2 cm. deep has effected several minor blood vessels in this.

The limb or body part will be stiff and hard to move for 3:10 days.\| \| 26-30 \| \(3.2,2.9\) \| An intermediate puncture that severs major bloods vessels and is 4 cm. deep is the damage done. Moderate bleeding will be present with pain throbbing form moderate to heavy. These will last for 4:10sd minutes and 2:10sd hours respectively.\| \| 31-35 \| \(3.6,3.4\) \| A heavy puncture is done. It cuts multiple major blood vessels causing heavy bleeding and pain throbbing between heavy and severe. The pain will continue for 3:10 sd hours and the bleeding will ease in 5:10sd minutes.\| \| 36-40 \| \(3.9,3.8\) \| A severe puncture is the result of the attack. It rips open a large portion of skin 8 cm. in diametre exposing 2 cm² of internal organs or bones. The implication are life-threatening if no medical attention is sought.\| \| ➕ 41-45 \| \(4.5,4.1\) \| The projectile has gone clear through up 10 cm. of flesh leaving a large exit hole and ripping out a large chunk of flesh. The pain will be severe throbbing to extreme and lasting 4:10sd minutes. The bleeding is severe and will last for 7:10sd minutes. If there is more than 10 cm. of flesh the projectile is still lodged in the flesh and should be removed.\| \| 46-50 \| \(5.5,5.3\) \| Minor tendon damage with heavy pain severe blood loss. swelling will occur and the area will be very sensitive to pressure either from use or an accidental bump.

| 1:10sd | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0 or 5 | BURNT: this burn is a few blisters with no real effect on exoskeleton. |
| 1 or 6 | RIPPED OPEN: A ripped open wound is a cauterized aperture of the surface layers, about 2 to 4 cm deep and 3 to 6  wide. This injury causes severe pain. If recieving this damage in a limb it may either be useless or be difficult to  use, depending on what race you are. Minus 10 off agility when using that limb and perform a CON check. to a character  with an exoskeleton this injury makes a chared crater 3 to 5 cm wide and 2 cm deep. |
| 2 or 7 | SURFACE LAYERS DAMAGED: This means the first ;half& cm of flesh or citian have recieved damage. Do a burn roll for  final damage. If you receive damage 5 and up do a CON check. The size of the damage depends on the location of the hit. Ex. the arm or leg, but on a chest, back or vital area the diametre would be about 5 to 10 cm. |
| 3 or 8 | SURFACE and LOWER TISSUE DAMAGE: This means the first 2 to 5 cm of flesh or citian have been burnt to the 2nd  and  3rd degree. If recieved in the head the character will pass out if their CON is 45 or less. To a character with light  armour or an exoskeleton this will cause surface layer damage. In either case medical attention is required. |
| 4 or 9 | BONE DAMAGE: This injury is deep, about 7 cm. and has burned the bone and caused it to crack. The tissue  surrounding the wound to 3 cm have recieved 3rd degree burns. This injury to the upper unprotected head would result in  death to anyone below 75 in CON. This injury to a character with light armour or an exoskeleton would result in surface  and lower tissue damage to both the 2nd  and  3rd degree. |

| 1:10sd | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0 | CUT: This injury does no damage to those races with exoskeletons or characters with heavy clothing or armour. If a  character receives this sort of injury the most it would do is bleed for a while. |
| 1 | SLICE: A slice is a very small laceration which will bleed for a sustained period of time and if done to a jointed  area eg. finger, back of knee or foot it can cause tendon damage. To a character with an exoskeleton, heavy clothing it  will be like a scrape or minor cut. Armor will only be marked as a result of this damage. |

2 \| PUNCTURE CUT: A puncture cut is a 1 - 2 cm deep cut which will continue to unless treated. This can remove fingers or severely hamper the use of joints or muscle groups. To a character with an exoskeleton it would be like a severe slice but armour would be uneffected. \|  
\| 3 \| DEEP PUNCTURE: A deep puncture is a 4 cm deep slit or hole which causes severe pain and bleeding. You should do a CON check. This injury causes major tissue damage that will cause loss of function in the affected muscle group. This can disable a joint or an entire limb. To a character with an exoskeleton it would cause a crack 6 cm long and 2 cm deep. This injury causes severe pain but use but use GM discretion to determine CON modifier. \|  
\| 4 \| IMPALED: The resulting puncture is 7 to 10 cm deep which will bleed until the wound is medically closed. This wound will damage any organ or bone directly under the point of impact. If bones or organs are present do a roll on the subsidiary damage tables to determine the results. To a character with an exoskeleton or very light armour the damage would be a 3 to 5 cm deep puncture causing severe pain, in both cases CON checks should be done. \|  
\| 5 \| HEAVY SLASH: A heavy slash is a 7 to 15 cm long cut about 2 to 4 cm deep that will bleed, cause pain and discomfort until treated. A wound of this sort to an arm or leg could cut it off and or make it useless. Light armour or exoskeleton would be cut through and the character would receive a SLICE. Characters with an exoskeleton should check CON. \|  
\| 6 \| HEAVY HACK: a Heavy hack is 7 to 10 cm long and 5 to 10 cm deep. It will bleed and cause more than just discomfort to the affected character until treated. If recieved in a limb it will cut it off or render it useless. Characters with an exoskeleton or light armour would get large crack 7 to 8 cm long and 3 cm deep. In both cases a CON check should be done. \|  
\| 7 \| SLASH PUNCTURE: SEE Descriptions \#3 and \#5 for damage done. \|  
\| 8 \| SLASH and GOUGE: SEE DESCRIPTION for the SLASH. A gouge is just a portion of skin and flesh or citian that has been ripped away from the character. It will bleed until death if not treated. A wound to an arm or leg would cut it off or render it useless. A CON check should be done. \|  
\| 9 \| SLASH IMPALED: SEE Descriptions \#4 and \#5 for damage done. \|

#### 19 - Projectile weapons

| die roll | descriptions | severity roll | damage percent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 or 5 | low velocity slug | - | 01-25 |
| 1 or 6 | medium velocity slug | - | 26-53 |

| 3 or 8 | high velocity soft point | 2 | 79-89 |
| 4 or 9 | extreme velocity hollow point or arcane | 2 + 3 | 90-99 |

Projectile damage varies due to the size of weapons and the range. shotguns do large amounts of damage to surface area and depending on the range can either kill or mame.

| 1:10sd | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0 or 5 | LOW VELOCITY SLUG: This round acts like it is traveling at a relatively low velocity. The round cause a impact cavity just 2cm larger than itself. The injury will bleed until treated and if received in the head kill any character with a CON less than 45. The round will penetrate light armour to a distance of ;half& cm and exoskeleton to a depth of 1;half& cm. |
| 1 or 6 | MEDIUM VELOCITY SLUG: This round has, upon impact, deformed to cause a large amount of tissue damage that will bleed until treated. If received in the head it will cause a concussion and dizziness to any with a CON over 50, death to those under 50. Light armour or exoskeleton will be dented or cracked by the force. |
| 2 or 7 | HIGH VELOCITY SLUG: This round acts like a hard point. If it is received in a soft area it will penetrate 12 cm into the flesh. It will lodge in or shatter any bone it hits. The wound will bleed until treated. If received in the head it will kill any character with a CON lower than 75. To a character with light armour or an exoskeleton it will 5 cm of tissues causing internal bleeding. |
| 3 or 8 | HIGH VELOCITY SOFT POINT: This round will, at point of impact, break hard or soft tissues into several peices causing major surface and internal damage with heavy bleeding. If received in the head the character will die unless their CON is greater than 85. To a lightly armoured character or one with an exoskeleton debris and shrapnel will penetrate up to cm into the tissue causing internal bleeding. |
| 4 or 9 | EXTREME VELOCITY HOLLOW POINT OR ARCANE: This bullet will make an aperture 3 times larger than the round itself. After impact the round will flatten out and destroy the surrounding tissues. If the area of impact is less than 65 cm in thickness the round will produce a hole 7 times bigger than the round itself. If received in the head the character will die unless their CON is over 95. To a character with light armour or a exoskeleton it will do the same damage as a unprotected character with a high velocity soft point. |

If shot by an automatic weapon the damage for all the bullets that hit is the same. If weapon is single fire a separate roll for each round that hits should be done.

| 0 or 5 | FLATENED: You have been knocked down by the explosion. Depending on the location it can damage either front, back or sides. It will cause dizziness to anyone with a mental strength lower lower than 65. In addition you must roll two  BLUDGEON damages assigned to two appropriate body parts. |
| 1 or 6 | I FLATENED + LACERATIONS: You have been knocked down by the force of the explosion. It will cause dizziness to  anyone with a mental strength lower than 75 for 1:10sd minutes. The damage done will be three BLUDGEON rolls and an additional HACK AND SLASH. For every roll, roll for a location. |
| 2 or 7 | II FLATENED + LACERATIONS: The force of the blast has thrown you back. If the characters mental strength is lower than 80 he will be dizzy for 2:10sd minutes. If mental strength is lower tan 60 the character will lose consciousness for 1:10sd minutes. The damage received is three BLUDGEON rolls and two HACK AND SLASH. |
| 3 or 8 | III FLATENED + LACERATIONS: Knocked back by the explosion the character will feel dizzy for 3:10sd minutes if their mental strength is lower than 85. Unconsciousness for 3:10sd minutes will result to any character with a mental strength lower than 70. The damage is three BLUDGEON rolls and three HACK AND SLASH rolls. If the explosion is a fragmentation do an extra HACK AND SLASH to another area. |
| 4 or 9 | IV FLATENED + LACERATIONS: The force of the blast will result in dizziness for 4:10sd minutes if the character's mental strength is less than 95. A mental strength less than 80 will cause unconscious for 4:10sd minutes. The damage received is three BLUDGEON rolls and FOUR HACK AND SLASH rolls.If the explosion is a fragmentation do an extra HACK AND SLASH to another area. |

For each new roll what ever it may be its damage should be allocated by another roll on the D.A.I.s.

#### 21 - Incendiary, mazer and sonic weapons

| die roll | descriptions | severity roll | damage percent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 or 5 | surface skin damage | - | 01-25 |
| 1 or 6 | surface muscle damage | - | 26-53 |

| 3 or 8 | surface tissue splitting | - | 79-89 |
| 4 or 9 | deep tissue splitting | 2 + 3 | 90-99 |

| 1:10sd | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0 or 5 | Surface Skin Damage: The injury recieved is 0.5 cm deep and in addition you must do a burn severity roll. If recieved in the head and the burn damage is 4 and up the character will feel dizzy if their CON is lower than 65 for 2:10sd min. If recieved in an area where the skin is thin eg. a hand the body part becomes stunned for 1st degree  1:10sd, 2nd degree 1;half&:10sd, and 3rd degree 2:10sd min. Note: P.C. with an exoskeleton will only receive a 1st degree burn to the tissue below with no effect to the surface. |
| 1 or 6 | Surface Muscle Damage: The injury recieved is 1 to 2 cm deep and 5 to 10 cm wide. Do a burn severity roll. If recieved in the head and the damage is between 0 and 7 the character will be dizzy for 3:10sd min. if the CON is lower than 70. If If above 7 the character will become unconscious for 3:10sd min. If recieved where skin is thin eg. the  hand, and the damage is 0 to 7 the body part will be stunned for 3:10sd min. If 7 and up the hand is useless until proper medical attention is recieved. Note: P.C. with an exoskeleton will only receive a 2nd degree burn to the tissue below with no effect to the surface. |
| 2 or 7 | Deep Tissue Damage: This injury is 2 to 5 cm deep and 5 to 10 wide. This is a 3rd degree burn and if recieved to the head the character will dire if thier CON is lower than 50. If the characters CON is under 65 they will fall into unconsciousness for 3:10sd min. Note: P.C. with an exoskeleton will only receive a 3rd degree burn to the tissue below and the exoskeleton to split and shear. |
| 3 or 8 | Surface Tissue Splitting: The mazer has caused the skin to explode. It is 1 to 2 cm deep and 5 to 10cm wide. This injury if recieved to the head will destroy the surrounding skin and cause the skull to fracture \(hair line\) the character will be rendered unconscious for 3:10sd min. if the characters' CON is lower than 65. This injury causes sever bleeding and pain and when recieved by a character with an exoskeleton the damage will remain constant but the area  effected will have the exoskeleton blown off. |
| 4 or 9 | Deep tissue Damage: The mazer has penetrated deep into the tissues, approximately 10cm, the muscle and tissues in this area have been exploded. When taken to the head by any character with a CON below 65 it will cause death and below 70, comma lasting for 4:10d hours if no medical attention is applied, and with attention 2:10ds hours. When consciousness returns partial memory loss is a distinct possibility lasting only a few days. Note: to a character with an exoskeleton the damage is the same as above but 10 to 20 cmý of the exoskeleton will be blown off. |

Remember Mazers, micro waves, heat up the water inside the tissues. To characters wearing metal armour the waves will bounce off and cause sparks. Sonics, sound waves, will cause the tissue to heat up or the tissue to fall off in small chunks.
