# BetweenTheRocks

“Sir, the computers just came back online.”&lt;/p&gt; “Well, do they confirm the visuals?”&lt;/p&gt; “Yes Sir!”&lt;/p&gt; “Run down the stats Mr. Kielan”&lt;/p&gt; “The computer is tracking the asteroid. Sensors are picking up high ore content. Large Deposits of Gold, Titanium, Palladium and traces of other metals as long as your arm.”&lt;/p&gt; “Is their a margin?”&lt;/p&gt; “Nine million cubic meters with a ratio of twelve to one.”&lt;/p&gt; “Position and vector Mr. Harcher”&lt;/p&gt; “It entered our claim six hours ago and is in a transfer orbit that will take it out in another two hours.”&lt;/p&gt; “Shit! Pull in the five and six crews. This is going to have be fast and dirty.”&lt;/p&gt; “Mr. Dlameani, find the fastest course to the asteroid.”&lt;/p&gt; “The sensors show a Kirkwood, Captain.”&lt;/p&gt; “Use it!”&lt;/p&gt; “It’s very small.”&lt;/p&gt; “I don’t care, I want that asteroid.”&lt;/p&gt; “Are the 5 and 6 crews in yet?”&lt;/p&gt; “Yes, Captain”&lt;/p&gt; “Engage the drive Mr. Dlameani, ETA at best speed?”&lt;/p&gt; “15 min. Captain.”&lt;/p&gt; “It’s going to be tight. I want all crews ready for immediate deployment when we reach station.”&lt;/p&gt;

 . . .&lt;/p&gt; “ETA Mr. Dlameani.”&lt;/p&gt; “30 seconds to station Captain.”&lt;/p&gt; “Are all crews ready?”&lt;/p&gt; “All report ready, Sir.”&lt;/p&gt; “ETA?”&lt;/p&gt; “10 seconds.”&lt;/p&gt; “Time until the asteroid leaves the claim Mr. Marcher?”&lt;/p&gt; “One hour and thirty-two minutes, Captain.”&lt;/p&gt; “Open the pod bay doors.”&lt;/p&gt; “Eye Eye.”&lt;/p&gt; “Attention all out-rigger crews, I want this operation to go smoothly. We only have one and a half hours and any time wasted will come off your commissions. Deploy, — NOW!”&lt;/p&gt; “All crews acknowledge deployment. Sir.”&lt;/p&gt; “Mr. Kielan, I want the data from the first samples.”&lt;/p&gt; “Updated ratio of nine to one. Percent composition of primary samples: 3.5% Gold, 1.7% Platinum, 2.5% Cobalt, 1.1% Palladium, and .5% Courant — the rest are just traces.”&lt;/p&gt; “Courant!?”&lt;/p&gt; “Yes, Captain.”&lt;/p&gt; “Are there any concentrations of it.”&lt;/p&gt; “The sensors indicate a vein on the far side.”&lt;/p&gt; “I want two crews on it as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt; “Out-rigger crews two and seven are in position on the far side and beginning there OP, Captain.”&lt;/p&gt; “Report Mr. Kielan”&lt;/p&gt; “Ratio of Courant ten to one.”&lt;/p&gt; “Do we have estimates on vein size.”&lt;/p&gt; “Computers estimate — One Million cubic meters. Captain!”&lt;/p&gt; “My God. This is the one.”&lt;/p&gt; “ETD until it leaves our Claim, Mr. Marcher.”&lt;/p&gt; “One hour and five minutes, Sir.”&lt;/p&gt; “Mr. Kielan, keep me updated on completion percentage.”&lt;/p&gt; “At the current rate we have five percent dusted, and time to full dust one hour and forty-nine minutes.”&lt;/p&gt; “Dam it! I want all teams to go to one hundred thirty percent.”&lt;/p&gt; “All out-riggers acknowledge.”&lt;/p&gt; “Mr. Bycore give me the stress data on the pods.”&lt;/p&gt; “All are working at maximum efficiency, there is a five percent chance of system failure every five minutes we maintain one thirty. Sir.”&lt;/p&gt; “Move another two crews to the far side.”&lt;/p&gt; “Crews four and five on station and starting their OP”&lt;/p&gt; “Mr. Kielan ?”&lt;/p&gt; “Fifteen percent dusted, and one hour and fifteen minutes to full dust.”&lt;/p&gt; “ETD of the asteroid out of our claim Mr. Marcher?”&lt;/p&gt; “Fifty minutes, Captain.”&lt;/p&gt; “ETD Mr. Harcher?”&lt;/p&gt;

 . . .&lt;/p&gt; “The Asteroid is now three minutes away from the line.”&lt;/p&gt; “Percentage Mr. Kielan?”&lt;/p&gt; “Eighty-three percent dusted, and fifteen minutes to full dust.”&lt;/p&gt; “Stress data Mr. Bycore.”&lt;/p&gt; “Seventy-eight percent average efficiency. Thirty percent chance of failure every minute.”&lt;/p&gt; “ETD Mr. Ha…”&lt;/p&gt; “Captain, pods three and seven have lost all power.”&lt;/p&gt; “Status on the crews Mr. Bycore?”&lt;/p&gt; “Out-riggers three and seven are on Batt backup and are drifting out of the claim.”&lt;/p&gt; “Dam it, Bycore, why weren’t they using pitons?”&lt;/p&gt; “The out-riggers are using station keeping thrusters and emergency lines to save time.”&lt;/p&gt; “Percent Mr. Kielan?”&lt;/p&gt; “Eighty five, 13 min to full.”&lt;/p&gt; “We are now across the line.”&lt;/p&gt; “Dlameani, Keep me posted on any host movements.”&lt;/p&gt; “Bycore, have the pods regained power?”&lt;/p&gt; “Yes, Captain. The pods are now back at station.”&lt;/p&gt; “Sir, Computer is tracking another mining vessel on an intercept course.”&lt;/p&gt; “Percent Mr. Kielan?”&lt;/p&gt; “Eighty nine, 10 min to full.”&lt;/p&gt; “Time to interception of the other vessel, Dlameani?”&lt;/p&gt; “Two minutes Captain.”&lt;/p&gt; “Sir, We are receiving a signal from the other ship.”&lt;/p&gt; “Out loud, Dlameani.”&lt;/p&gt; “They are demanding that we leave their claim immediately or they will destroy our vessel and all crews for the crime of claim jumping.”&lt;/p&gt; “Pull in the crews Mr. Bycore.”&lt;/p&gt;

 . . .&lt;/p&gt; “Sir, the other ship is now retreating form our claim.”&lt;/p&gt; “Give, me the stats on the asteroid Mr. Raoklan”&lt;/p&gt; “The computer is tracking. Sensors show high ore content. Deposits of Gold, Titanium, Palladium and traces of other metals.”&lt;/p&gt; “What’s the margin?”&lt;/p&gt; “Nine hundred thousand cubic meters with a ratio of ten to one.”&lt;/p&gt; “Position and vector Mr. Garone”&lt;/p&gt;

The mining of the Milmoth \(a.k.a.\) Vega solar system, has created a conflict due to the constant claim-jumping of the various entities of miners currently in that system. The local government is trying to keep law-and-order with the assistance of Military Aero Space Security \(M.A.S.S.\)
